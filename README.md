  As a developer, I want a README generator so that I can quickly create a professional README for a new project.

  # <a name="Criteria"> Criteria For Completion </a>
  GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input <br>
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository <br>
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions <br>
WHEN I enter my project title <br>
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README <br>
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions <br>
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests <br>
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options <br>
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under <br>
WHEN I enter my GitHub username <br>
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile <br>
WHEN I enter my email address <br>
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions <br>
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents <br>
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README <br>
